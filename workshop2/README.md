# Workshop 2

## Exercise 1

Write a Python program that accepts a list of numerical values and finds its maximum value without using the built-in `max()` function.

**Input:** `[6, 3, 9, 2, 10, 31, 15, 7]`

**Output:** `31`

## Exercise 2

Write a Python program that accepts a list and removes its duplicate elements.

**Input:** `["this", "is", "a", "real", "real", "real", "story"]`

**Output:** `["this", "is", "a", "real", "story"]`

## Exercise 3

Write a Python program that accepts a list which can contain sublists (only one level of nesting) and generates a flattened list.

**Input:** `[0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]`

**Output:** `[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]`

## Exercise 4

Write a Python program that accepts a list and generates another list by removing consecutive duplicate elements.

**Input:** `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`

**Output:** `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]`

## Exercise 5

Write a Python program that accepts a list of lists representing a numeric matrix and computes the sum of the elements on the main diagonal.

**Input:** `[[4, 6, 1], [2, 9, 3], [1, 7, 7]]`

**Output:** `20`
