# Practice 1 - Mobile Phone

Create a Mobile class that represents a mobile phone based on the following class members:

- Attributes:

  - name (string)
  - apps (list of strings)
  - status (integer) (0: off, 1: on)

- Methods:

  - `__init__(self, name)`
  - `power_on(self)`
  - `power_off(self)`
  - `install_apps(self, *apps)`
  - `uninstall_apps(self, *apps)`

## Testing

Create at least one (mobile) instance from the created class and "play" with the methods, visualizing how their attributes change.
