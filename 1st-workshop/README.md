# 1st Workshop

This folder contains my solutions for the following exercises, each addressing a specific task using the indicated programming structures and statements.

## Exercise 1

Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculates a metric defined as the total number of characters in the string multiplied by the total number of vowels it contains. Vowels should be considered in uppercase and accented forms.

**Input:** "Hola A Todos los Estudiantes del sal√≥n!"
**Output:** 546

**Using:** Strings, string functions
**Not using:** Loops, conditionals.

## Exercise 2

Develop an algorithm that prompts the user for a year between 1904 and 2196 (inclusive) after validating that the input is an integer within the specified range. Determine whether the year is a leap year or not. A year is considered a leap year in the Gregorian calendar if it's divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it's divisible by 400.

**Input:** 2008
**Output:** 2008 is a leap year

**Using:** Strings, while loop (for validation), variable type checking, conditionals.
**Not using:** For loop.

## Exercise 3

Design a user validation algorithm that prompts for a login and a password, then compares both values with constants stored in the program. If the user enters the correct values, display the message "Login and password correct" and terminate the program. Otherwise, display "Incorrect login" or "Incorrect password" or "Incorrect login and password" accordingly. The user is allowed to repeat the process a maximum of three times. If the incorrect password is entered more than three times, display a "User locked" message.

**Using:** Statements covered up to this date.

## Exercise 4

Program an algorithm that requests 5 integer numbers from the user (validating for positive or negative integers). Then, display the following: the minimum value, the maximum value, the sum of the numbers, the average, and the numbers sorted from highest to lowest.

**Not using:** Lists or similar data structures.
